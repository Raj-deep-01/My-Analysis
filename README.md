Hey there, Rajdeep here. This is my very first practical project in Data Analytics.
This dashboard provides insights on the crop production in India.
The range of the data collected is from 1998 to 2014.
The main KPIs are : Production, Area, State-wise production, Geographical location, Season.
The main crops produced as well as their cultivation areas are highlighted.
Analysed how cultivation area has been on the decrease even when production seems to have increased as per the data.
Factored the role of Weather and Geographic location on the cultivation of certain crops.
Analysed the impact of food habits of people of certain regions on the cultivation of major crops.
